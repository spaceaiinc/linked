/**
 * API Route: Handles image uploads for the Vision app.
 *
 * This route supports both file uploads and image URL uploads.
 * - For uploaded files:
 *   - Accepts multipart/form-data with an image file.
 * - For image URLs:
 *   - Accepts application/json with an `imageUrl` field.
 *
 * **Process:**
 * 1. Authenticates the user.
 * 2. Extracts the file or image URL from the request.
 * 3. Generates a unique file name using UUID.
 * 4. Calls `uploadFile` to handle the upload and optimization.
 * 5. Returns the public URL and path of the uploaded image.
 *
 * @param {NextRequest} request - The incoming request object.
 * @returns {Promise<NextResponse>} JSON response containing the uploaded image URL and path.
